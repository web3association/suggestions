# Determine which disbursement approaches to experiment with

**Suggestion**

There are a number of approaches to disburse treasury assets that each have their own advantages and drawbacks. There is currently a lack of evidence to suggest a one size fits all approach is the optimum solution for treasury disbursement. Due to this it will be beneficial for ecosystems to consciously decide which approaches they want to experiment with and create a hypothesis for what outcomes they believe they would like to achieve from testing that approach. The more that experiments that can occur across the industry the faster the industry will be able to identify some of the most promising approaches for the different use cases that can exist. Some question an ecosystem can ask itself are why are they currently adopting a certain approach? What outcomes are they expecting over adopting other approaches? When and how do they intend to experiment with other approaches for different use cases?



**Reasons to adopt this suggestion**

* **Find the most effective disbursement processes** - Adopting a experimentation based approach to test out different disbursement approaches can be a highly effective way to validate any assumptions and discover which approaches end up generating the most impactful outcomes. Experimentation can lead to increasing the accuracy and efficiency in how assets get disbursed to generate impactful outcomes.
* **Provides learnings for ecosystem & wider industry** - An ecosystem could openly state why they are trialling certain approaches over others and then report on the outcomes that emerge. This openness with experimentation and sharing results could benefit the communities emerging within that ecosystem who also need to handle treasury assets and disbursement processes and also similarly would help the wider industry through shared learnings.



**Reasons to ignore this suggestion**

* **Higher cost to experiment** - Developing software and new processes to experiment with different approaches could lead to an increase in costs for operating and maintaining a disbursement process. For ecosystems that need to keep their operation as lean as possible they will want to be more deliberate about exactly where they conduct any experiments to avoid wasting resources. Staying lean does still need to be balanced with making continued improvements to treasury systems and processes to prevent an ecosystem falling behind other competing ecosystems.
