# Document an ecosystems mission, principles & values

**Suggestion**

An ecosystem can benefit from documenting its mission, principles or values that are already defined or more socially agreed by the community to better express what an ecosystem is looking to achieve and represent. An ecosystems mission, principles or values could be captured in a number of different documents, such as a constitution, community manifesto, mission statement or value statement. An ecosystem may also decide that there is currently no defined mission, principles or values that need to be documented if nothing substantial has already been established or agreed within the ecosystem.



**Reasons to adopt this suggestion**

* **Helps with building community** - Documenting a mission or any principles or values can help with marketing an ecosystem as it can make it easier for people to understand what an ecosystem is trying to achieve and what purpose or beliefs the ecosystem might have. Having easier access to this information could help with attracting other people outside the ecosystem that may resonate with the overall purpose, principles or values.
* **Increases community clarity** - Clearly defining the mission, principles or values can help with increasing the clarity the community has on what the founding entity and/or the rest of community is thinking about and what they currently most value. This clarity can help with increasing alignment around prioritisation efforts and help with future discussions about what areas or outcome will be the most important for the ecosystem when thinking about any disbursement decisions.



**Reasons to ignore this suggestion**

* **The ecosystem doesnâ€™t have a defined mission or any principles and values** - Some ecosystems may be creating general purpose protocols that have a fairly simple end goal in mind. In these circumstances the founding entities or community may decide to not formally document any defined mission, principles or values. An ecosystem with even a simple mission can still find value in documenting the overall vision of the ecosystem to help with communicating this message to potential community members who might be interested in the ecosystem.
* **Ecosystem documents already exists** - Ecosystems that have already documented some of their mission, principles or values would mainly now just be concerned with how those documents are maintained and changed over time. For instance if an ecosystem started to prioritise different areas within the ecosystem this may be a sign that the initial mission, principles or values might be changing within the community. An ecosystem will benefit from being able to update any of the mission, principles or values that have been documented as the ecosystem and community evolve and change over time.
