# Create a list of information resources & systems

**Suggestion**

Ecosystems benefit from being able to determine which sources of information will be most useful when making disbursement decisions. A list of potentially useful areas of information can be used to create a simple knowledge system, these existing information sources can be listed in a single document for voters to learn about an ecosystem and make more well informed disbursement decisions.



**Reasons to adopt this suggestion**

* **Knowledge systems can provide a number of advantages** - In some separate analysis the advantages of knowledges systems were outlined. These included how they can be effective for verifiable information, helping voters become more well informed, reducing the time required for voters to participate, reducing information complexity, providing a scalable solution for informing voters, increasing transparency & awareness, decreasing the time for new information to propagate and creating more automation and integration opportunities.
* **Identify missing information sources** - Creating a simple aggregation of the informational sources available in an ecosystem can help with identifying which areas of information are either currently missing or not well covered. Understanding where these gaps are can help an ecosystem with directing more efforts towards improving the availability and access to these different areas of information that are the most useful for voters when making any future decisions.
* **Improve understanding of the decision complexity** - The more aware an ecosystem is about what information will be useful for making informed disbursement decisions the better it will be at determining how complex each of their processes and decisions are for disbursement. This understanding can then be used to explore how any systems that gather and present information could be potentially improved. Improvements could range from trying to simplify the decision processes or cover how knowledge systems are being integrated into any decision process to make it easier for voters to make well informed decisions.



**Reasons to ignore this suggestion**

* **A list of information resources & systems already exists** - If this list already exists then some next steps would be thinking about how that list is maintained and how community members are able to suggest changes or additions to the list of information sources currently being suggested.
