# Determine how prioritisation should be handled

**Suggestion**

Ecosystems benefit from being able to identify, discuss and prioritise the different problems and opportunities that exist which could then also create impact for the ecosystem if they were addressed. An ecosystem would want a prioritisation system and process that is able to handle sudden changing circumstances, preferences and environments that the community might need to respond to quickly. One potential solution approach which could be effective for helping with priority setting is the adopting of an independent priority setting process. This approach can offer a number of advantages for improving a disbursement process. A well designed priority setting process should help with making it easier for contributors to suggest priorities and for voters to participate in any discussions or votes about which of these priorities is the most important for the ecosystem.



**Reasons to adopt this suggestion**

* **Good prioritisation helps with funding impactful initiatives** - Prioritisation is important for the disbursement process for ensuring that funding gets allocated to impactful initiatives. Impactful initiatives will help an ecosystem address its shorter and longer term priorities. Prioritisation can highly influence how resources get allocated through which initiatives get selected to receive funding. An ecosystem will greatly benefit from being able to suggest, discuss and decide on which problems and opportunities are the most important for the ecosystem at the moment.
* **An independent priority process could provide a number of advantages** - Prioritisation can help improve how effectively treasury assets are directed to impactful initiatives. Using an independent priority process can help with increasing voter participation and choice optionality, decreasing voter decision complexity, decreasing future change and contributor participation complexity, increasing the ability for an ecosystem to handle a fast changing environment, encouraging more reflection and discussion, inspiring new ideas, increasing healthy competition between priorities, increasing integration opportunities and improving community alignment.



**Reasons to ignore this suggestion**

* **A prioritisation system is already in place** - If a prioritisation system is already in place the main areas of further thought and feedback would be around how community members are able to contribute to that priority setting process and provide their own opinions on the different potential priorities. For foundations that operate their own prioritisation process internally this might mean thinking of ways to involve the community in the process by gathering some of their opinions prior to any internal decision making.
